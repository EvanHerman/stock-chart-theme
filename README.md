# Stock Chart Theme
Small side project, building out a fully customized WordPress theme. Something stock related - still not sure yet.

I started building out this project just to play with some APIs.

The dashboard appearance of the theme is a customized version of [Dashgum](https://github.com/esironal/dashgum-template).

All stock data is pulled from the [Yahoo finance API](https://code.google.com/p/yahoo-finance-managed/wiki/YahooFinanceAPIs).
